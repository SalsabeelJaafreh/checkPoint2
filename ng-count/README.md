## ngCount
* Show off your knowledge of Angular by building a persistent count app
* [ ] Your app should increase or decrease the count when the appropriate buttons are pressed
  * The count will need to be accessible to all three controllers
  * Do not edit the html

* You'll need to serve ngCount as a web page (not from a file).

1. If you don't already have python, `brew install python` to get it
  * See if you have `python` with `which python`
1. Use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from this directory to serve the page
1. Navigate to 0.0.0.0:8000 in a browser to find what you're serving
* When you have a chance, look up setting up an alias in your shell's profile, and consider setting a `serve` profile for this command
